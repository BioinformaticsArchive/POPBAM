{"name":"POPBAM","tagline":"Tools for Evolutionary Analysis of Short Read Sequence Alignments","body":"While many bioinformatics tools currently exist for assembling and discovering variants from next-generation sequence data, there are very few tools available to perform evolutionary analyses from these data. Evolutionary and population genomics studies hold great promise for providing valuable insights into natural selection, the effect of mutations on phenotypes, and the origin of species. Thus, there is a need for a standardized and flexible computational tool that can fit into a growing number of evolutionary bioinformatics pipelines.\r\n\r\nThe POPBAM software is comprehensive set of computational tools for evolutionary analysis of whole-genome alignments consisting of multiple individuals, from multiple populations or species. POPBAM works directly from BAM-formatted assembly files, it calls variant sites, and calculates a variety of commonly used evolutionary sequence statistics. POPBAM is designed primarily to perform analyses in sliding windows across chromosomes or scaffolds. POPBAM accurately measures nucleotide diversity, population divergence, linkage disequilibrium, and the frequency spectrum of mutations from two or more populations. POPBAM can also produce phylogenetic trees of all samples in a BAM file. POPBAM is both fast and memory-efficient, and also can feasibly scale to the analysis of large BAM files with many individuals and populations.\r\n\r\nThe POPBAM program is written in C/C++ and has few dependencies, it can be built on a variety of Linux platforms. The program is open source and users are encouraged to participate in the development of this resource. A manuscript describing the functionality and performance of POPBAM is currently submitted to the journal _Evolutionary Bioinformatics_.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
